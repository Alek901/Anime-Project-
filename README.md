# User Story: Track Watched Anime

As a registered user of RamenReel,
I want to be able to mark anime series as "watched",
So that I can keep track of the anime I've completed and easily see what I haven't watched yet.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. On each anime detail page, there should be a clearly visible "Mark as Watched" button.
2. When I click the "Mark as Watched" button, the system should:
   - Update my user profile to include this anime in my "Watched" list
   - Change the button to "Marked as Watched" with a visual indicator
   - Reflect this change immediately without requiring a page refresh
3. I should be able to view my complete "Watched" list in my user profile.
4. In my "Watched" list, each entry should display:
   - The anime title
   - A thumbnail image
   - The date I marked it as watched
5. I should be able to remove anime from my "Watched" list if I marked it by mistake.
6. The system should use this information to improve my personalized anime recommendations.

## Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the "Watched" status is saved even if I log out and log back in.
- Consider adding a feature to mark individual episodes as watched for ongoing series.
- Think about integrating this feature with a possible "Watchlist" feature for anime I plan to watch.
